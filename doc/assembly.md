## Required components

### General

&nbsp; | Name | Comment
-------|------|--------
1 | [PCB & Components](https://easyeda.com/reflow/reflow-micro-table) | Go to EasyEda project page and order both in couple of clicks. If you order PCB first, components second, then you will be able to join delivery and save some bucks.
2 | [Rocker switch](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Rocker-Switches_HONGJU-MR6-210-C5L-BR_C268234.html) |
3 | [2.4" Display](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32852776943.html) | 240*320, SPI, ILI9341, touch screen.
4 | [Power cord](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32961795481.html) |
5 | [Cooling fan 5010](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000194163972.html) |
6 | [22 AWG wire](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32854919883.html) | Optional, SMT stencil positioning.
7 | [DIN965 M1.6 SS screws 20mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33013472653.html) | Mount heater plate to PCB. Should be stainless steel, important!
8 | [DIN965 M1.6 black screws 8mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000217127933.html) | MCH mount
9 | [M1.6 SS washers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000222547150.html) | MCH mount
10 | [M1.6 SS spring lock washers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000222556028.html) | MCH mount
11 | [M2 inserts 3mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000513304304.html) | Case components mount places.
12 | [M2 flat cap screws 14mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000217127933.html) | Case assembly, cooling fan mount.
13 | [M2 Spring lock washers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32982630546.html) | Hinges assembly.
14 | [M2 washers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32859516826.html) | Hinges assembly.
15 | [M2 nuts](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32859946901.html) | Hinges assembly, cooling fan mount.
16 | [M2 flat cap screws 8mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000217127933.html) | Hinges assembly.
17 | [Mushroom head M2 screws 5mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000168030333.html) | PCB mount.
18 | [MCH 50*50*2mm 150W](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33005272347.html) | [Alternate](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32991559341.html). Minimal power at room temp - 130W. For 110 volts buy 300W one.
19 | [Aluminium plate 4mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32998175339.html) | [Alternate](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32985318306.html).  Heater. You may also wish to buy 2mm plate for shims, if have no circular saw.
20 | Aluminum Foil 50Î¼m (0.05mm) | Heater bottom insulation. Such foil is sold for sauna insulation. You can also try foil from baking forms.
21 | [Aluminium sticky tape](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33036337241.html) | PCB reflector. You need fat, 50-100um tape, 30-50mm wide. Don't use cheap thin one, it will not work as needed.
22 | Temperature resistant black paint | Coating for heater top.
23 | [Thermal conductive paste](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32870824982.html) | Should work at 300C. Don't try cheap ones.

Note. You are strongly advised to order SMT stencil for your PCB. That will
add ~ 8$ in total to your order - good price for convenience. On placing stencil
order at jlcpcb, select option "custom size", and define small one. Then stencil
will be compact and light, with small delivery cost.


### Optional

See [heater assembly](heater_assembly.md) docs for details. May be you already
have drill stand and so on.

If you are patient enough, you can cut aluminum with hand saw. But circular
saw is much more convenient.
